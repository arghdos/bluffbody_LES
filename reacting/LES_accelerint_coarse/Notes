Mesh Creation
-------------

A coarse LES case to push out the initial transience, and give a good starting point for the full LES simulations
Uses the initial RANS mesh:

>python buildMesh.py -c non-reacting/CASE/ -m 4 -w 0.85 -g 1.2 -l 1.1 -uy 1.15 -uz 1.2

Which corresponds to:
-a 4mm mesh
-wall spacing of 0.85mm ~ 40 * y+ (http://www.pointwise.com/yplus/)
-geometric expansion ratio (GER) in the y-axis downstream of BB = 1.2
-GER=1.15 in the y-axis upstream of BB
-GER=1.2 in z-direction upstream of the BB
-GER=1.1 in z-direction downstream of the BB
