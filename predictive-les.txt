Impact of Numerics on Predictive Capabilities of Reacting Flow LES
------------------------------------------------------------------

--experiment:
	-- Volvo Flygmotor AB program
	-- bluff body (BB) in channel
		-- BB is equilateral triangle, D=40mm per side
		-- air mass flow rate of 0.6 kg/s
		-- gaseous propane
		-- phi = 0.65
		-- Tin = 288K
		-- Tad = 1784K
		-- Re  = 48000 (based on D of BB)
		-- Channel is 3xD = 3 x 40 = 120mm tall
		-- Channel is 6xD = 6 x 40 = 240mm wide
		-- Channel extends 0.682 m downstream

--simulation setup:
 	-- OpenFOAM
 	-- For reacting flows:
 		-- noted under LESLIE3D, it seems to also apply to OpenFOAM?
		-- third-order MUSCL scheme for spatial discretization of Euler fluxes
	-- 2nd order accurate, bounded central scheme used for spatial discretization of inviscid terms
		-- bounded by Sweby limiter
	-- 2nd order accurate central scheme used for discretization of Laplacian terms in system of equations
	-- 2nd order accurate implicit (backwards difference) scheme for temporal integration
	-- PISO (pressure-implicit split-operator) used for pressure-velocity coupling
	-- Green-Gauss node based method used for gradient calculations
	-- same schemes used for non-reaction and reaction simulations
	-- pressure-based solver employed

	-- they use _premixed_ progress variable approach - could be problem?
	-- Smagorinsky sub-grid model
		-- closed through use of Boussinesq approximation
		-- Model constant Cs = 0.2
		-- Filter width \delta = (cell volume) ^ (1/3)
	-- To close progress variable transport equation, sub-grid scale combustion model used:
		-- Flame Surface Density model of Weller et al.
		-- C_\epsilon = 1.048
		-- C_k = 0.02
	-- Adiabatic conditions for thermodynamic coupling for OpenFOAM


-- grid:
	-- boundary layer ~ 1 / \sqrt{Re_D}
		-- bulk Re, based off D and inflow velocity Uo=17m/s
	-- filter width ~ 3mm based on 80% of kinetic energy capture in non-reacting, high-Reynolds number flow
		-- but not a general criteria for reacting-flow
	-- clustering near walls used to resolve at least log-layer region of turbulent boundary layer
	-- points clustered near the wall, with minimum wall normal distance equal to 0.3 mm
	-- gradually streched to free-stream resolution:
		-- 3 different free-stream grid sizes, 4, 2 & 1 mm
	-- grids are nearly isotropic
	-- grid had depth of 2 BB-widths (opposed to 6 in experiment)
		-- periodic boundary conditions employed in on width-wise walls
	-- grid startes 0.1m upstread of BB, and extend 0.682 m downstream
	-- no-slip BC on BB, top & bottom walls of combustor duct
	-- total cell count:
		-- 4mm = 0.31 * 10 ^ 6
		-- 2mm = 1.76 * 10 ^ 6
		-- 1mm = 10.5 * 10 ^ 6
	-- time-steps:
		-- non-reacting = 1e-6s
		-- reacting 	= 3e-7s
		-- obtained by CFL-criteria

Comparison of LES Models Applied to a Bluff Body Stabilized Flame
-----------------------------------------------------------------
-- two premixed experimental cases
	1)
		-- p0 = 101 kpa
	 	-- v0 = 17.3 m/s
	 	-- T0 = 288 K
	 	-- Re ~ 46000
	 	-- Inflow turbulence ~ 3%
	 	-- phi ~ 0.6
	2)
		-- p0 = 101 kpa
		-- v0 = 34.3 m/s
		-- T0 = 600 K
		-- Re ~ 28000
		-- Inflow turbulence ~ 3%
		-- phi ~ 0.6

-- models
	-- Flamelet level-set G-equation
		-- not finite-rate chemistry, so I don't care
	-- finite rate chemistry
		-- Two-step mechanism from Gri-Mech 2.1
			-- CH4 fuel
		-- Thickened Flame Model (TFM)
			-- applies thickening-scaling such that flame is reslved on LES grid, while laminar flame-speed is unchanged
		-- Partially Stirred Reactor (PaSR)
			-- filtered reaction rates re-writtend -> filtered = (filtered / resolved) * resolved
			-- then (filtered / resolved) ratio is empirically modeled (in this work) as k = the reacting volume fraction
				-- k estimated from mass flow considerations:
					k = t_c / (t_c + t_m),
				where t_c and t_m are chemical and mixing time scale respectively
			-- t_c ~ \delta_1 / s_u^0 ~ D / \bar{\rho} / (s_u^0)^2
				where \delta_1 is flame thickness, s_u^0 laminar flame speed
			-- t_m ~ \Delta \ v^{\prime}
				v^{\prime} = \sqrt{2k / 3}, the subgrid velocity
			-- if k = 1 -> quasi-laminar model (QL)
		-- Eddy Dissipation Concept (EDC)
			-- flow split into:
				-- fine structures, where mixing and reactions assumed to take place
				-- surroundings, dominated by large-scale flow structures
				-- related via 2-parameters balance equations:
					-- \tau^{\star} = subgrid residence time
					-- \gamma^{\star} = intermittency factor
				-- in this work, the parameters estimated from model of energy cascade (K41 hypothesis):
					-- model constant \Xi ~ 0.57
		-- Presumed Probabilility Distribution Density Function (PPDF)
			-- presumes a joint PDF for \rho, T, Y
			-- \rho, T, Y assumed independent
			-- in this study, multivariate \beta-PDF and clipped Gaussian PDFs used
		-- unresolved transport terms in momentum energy and species for TFM and PaSR closed with Mixed Model (MM)
			-- one equation eddy viscosity model (OEEVM) subgrid-model
-- solvers
	-- in-house
		-- high-order finite-difference discretizaton
		-- incrompressivle solver
		-- momentum and continuity discretized using:
			-- 5th order weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme for convective terms
			-- 4th order central difference fro remaining terms
		-- 2nd order implicittime integration
		-- G-Equation discretized using 3rd order WENO scheme
			-- integrated using 3rd order total variation diminishing (TVD) runge-kutta

		-- capable of incompressible / compressible, reactive flows
		-- time integration performed w/ 2nd order semi-implicit Crank Nickelson
			-- couple with PISO procedure based on Rhie & Chow interpolation for cell-centered data storage
		-- stability imposed via compact stencils and enforcing conservation of kinetic energy
		-- fixed CFL number ~ 0.4
	-- openfoam domain
		-- extends 0.32m upstream / 0.68m downstream of bluff body trailing edge
		-- spanwise extent is 0.12 m
			-- periodic boundary conditions spanwise
		-- unstructured grid of ~2.2*10^6 cells used
			-- refined towards upper and lower walls, and bluff body
			-- increased resolution in shear layers downstreadm of the flamholder
		-- characterstic spacing ranges from 4mm to 0.5mm
	-- boundary conditions
		-- steady inflow for velocity / temperature / combustion variables
		-- wave-transmissive outflow conditions used on outflow
		-- no-slip isothermal BC's on upper & lower walls
			-- Wall temperature = 288 K for case 1, 600K for case 2
		-- adiabatic no-slip wall boundary conditions on bluff body

OpenFOAM notes
--------------
-- ensure Courant number <= 1
	-- Co = dt |U| / dx
-- discretization
	-- gradients
		-- Cocks
			-> green-gauss node-based method
			-> Closest option appears to be "Gauss linear"
				-- this is cell-based, instead of node-based
	-- temporal
		-- Cocks:
			-- 2nd order accurate implicit backwards difference
		-- Baudoin:
			-- 2nd order semi-implicit Crank-Nickleson
	-- Laplacian
		-- Cocks:
			-- 2nd order accurate central scheme
			-> Gauss linear corrected;
	-- surface normal gradient schems
		-- cocks:
			-- no mention, seemingly "corrected"  as this is the only
			   second order scheme for the Laplacian
		-- Baudoin:
			-- split into orthogonal / non-orthogonal parts
				-- central difference for orthongal part
				-- face interpolation of gradients for non-orthogonal parts
	-- divergence
		 -- cocks:
		 	-- 2nd order accurate, bounded, central sceme used for spatial discretization of invisid terms:
		 		-- this appears to be advection terms
				-- bounded w/ Sweby limiter
				-- https://cfd.direct/openfoam/user-guide/fvSchemes/#x19-1450004.4.3
					--> advective and diffusive terms often treated differently
					--> "non-advective terms typically use Gauss integration w/ linear interpolation":
						"limitedLinear and  upwind schemes are commonly used, with the additional appearance of vanLeer, another limited scheme, with less strong limiting than  limitedLinear."
			--> "bounded Gauss linear"?
			--> doc's state that you typically place more emphasis on boundedness than accuracy for scalars (rather than velocity)
				--> limitedLinear?
				--> limiteLinear01 for mass fractions
	-- interpolation schemes
		-- linear
