Initial Conditions
------------------

Start with potential flow solution (mapFields from decompose)

Scheme
------

The fvSchemes used here are designed to be very diffusive to get rid of the large
ugly pressure waves (and instability caused therein), specifically to be used as an
input to the regular RANS simulation

You will want to run at a fairly large time-step (1e-5s) for a long while to get
rid of the transients
