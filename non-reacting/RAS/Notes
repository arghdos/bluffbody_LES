Notes
-----

- http://www.pointwise.com/yplus/, the expected y+ is ~0.017 mm, hence we need a wall treatment
- Mesh is different from LES case, place first cell at 1mm,  -> ~58 * y+
- this will require interpolation via mapFields for the LES initialization case

Mesh Creation
-------------

For both RANS & Potential, the mesh is created with:

>python buildMesh.py -c non-reacting/CASE/ -m 4 -w 1 -g 1.25 -l 1.05

Which corresponds to a 4mm mesh, w/ wall spacing of 0.85mm.
The geometric expansion ratio in the y-direction is 1.2, while in the z-direction (downstream of the BB)
it is 1.1

This yields a mesh of 225720 cells, which is nice and cheap for simulation
