Notes
-----

- http://www.pointwise.com/yplus/, the expected y+ is ~0.017 mm, hence we need a wall treatment
- Mesh is different from LES case, place first cell at 1mm,  -> ~58 * y+
- this will require interpolation via mapFields for the LES initialization case

Mesh Creation
-------------

For both RANS & Potential, the mesh is created with:

>python buildMesh.py -c non-reacting/CASE/ -m 4 -w 1 -g 1.25 -l 1.05

Which corresponds to a 4mm mesh, w/ wall spacing of 0.85mm.
The geometric expansion ratio in the y-direction is 1.2, while in the z-direction (downstream of the BB)
it is 1.1

This yields a mesh of 225720 cells, which is nice and cheap for simulation

Initial Conditions
------------------

First, start with potential flow solution (mapFields from decompose)
Next, run in Laminar mode to get an initial solution
Finally run w/ RAS

Boundary Outlet Conditions
--------------------------

Since I'm seeing reflections from the boundary (that grow out of control for LES), we will play with outlet-BC's in RANS

Possible conditions:

outlet:
	-U:
		fluxCorrectedVelocity
			- mix of zeroGradient & flux corrected (takes into account fixed pressure boundary condition)
		inletOutlet w/ inlet set to zero?
			- zero gradient for outflow, zero inflow
		pressureDirectedInletOutletVelocity
			- velocity B.C. for patches where pressure is specified
			- zero gradient for out flow (defined by flux)
			- inflow direction specified, velocity determined from flux in this direction
		pressureInletOutletVelocity
			- velocity B.C. for patches where pressure is specified
			- zero gradient for outflow
			- inflow obtained from patch-face normal
