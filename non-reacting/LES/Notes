Mesh Creation
-------------

For both LES

>python buildMesh.py -c non-reacting/LES/ -m 2 -w 0.3 -g 1.1 -uy 1.1 -l 1.05 -uz 1.05

Which corresponds to a 2mm mesh, w/ wall spacing of 0.3mm.
The geometric expansion ratio in the y-direction is 1.15, while in the z-direction (downstream of the BB)
it is 1.05

This yields a mesh of 2365000 cells, which is slightly more than Cocks et al., but they
also did not include the full inlet
