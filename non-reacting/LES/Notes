Mesh Creation
-------------

For both LES

>python buildMesh.py -c non-reacting/LES/ -m 2 -w 0.3 -g 1.1 -uy 1.1 -l 1.05 -uz 1.05

Which corresponds to a 2mm mesh, w/ wall spacing of 0.3mm.
The geometric expansion ratio in the y-direction is 1.15, while in the z-direction (downstream of the BB)
it is 1.05

This yields a mesh of 2365000 cells, which is slightly more than Cocks et al., but they
also did not include the full inlet

-Scheme Changes
---------------
faceMDLimited ~ 0.05s

limitedLinear (non-V) ~ 0.142s


Attempts to fix broadening of near field velocity
-------------------------------------------------
All starting at 0.142s

LES/
    - switch to limitedLinear (non-V) at 0.142s & drop write time to 5e-4s
    - slightly better match of negative velocity peak
    - axial velocity still is positive next to the back of the BB
    - -ve velocity peak shifted downstream
    - similar to limitedU but a bit smoother due to more runtime

LES_limitedU
    - switch grad(U) -> cellMDLimited leastSquares 0.5
    - switch div(phi,U) -> Gauss linear;
    - start to seem (limited) breakup, the near field axial velocity is still broadened
    - the negative velocity peak is a much closer match however, although shifted a bit downstream
    - after one Run switch grad(U) -> cellMDLimited leastSquares 0.5 -> grad(U) -> cellMDLimited leastSquares 0.75
    - still (nearly) positive velocity right near the back of the BB
    - BAD

LES_rho_thermo
    - switch to rhoReactingFoam
    - -ve velocity peak downshifted (positive velocity near BB)
    - doing that annoying thing where the temperature plummits
    - BAD

LES_limitedLinear2
    - use limitedLinear 0.33 for U & K
    - axial deficit peak shifted downstream (broadend in near field)
    - a bit wonky y-velocities
    - BAD

LES_LUST
    - use LUST for velocity like the fireFoam LES example
    - switch gradSchemes to "default Gauss linear;" (i.e., drop "corrected" -- can't find a reference to it anywhere)
    - recirculation zone bubble is still a bit downshifted and broadened near the BB
    - y velocity profiles off
    - better than the regular LES a bit

LES_no_corrected
    - switch gradSchemes to "default Gauss linear;" (i.e., drop "corrected" -- can't find a reference to it anywhere)
    - no discernable effect
    - broadend and mismatch

LES_wolf
    - leastSquares on all limits
    - linear for all divschemes (except the Yi's / h)
    - breakup *BAD*

LES_wolf2
    - dt -> CN 0.333
    - cellMdLimited Gauss Linear 1.0 on all gradients
    - *** THIS HAS THE BEST RESULTS OF ANY SCHEME SO FAR ***
    - doesn't quite match -ve velocity peak, but all other profiles are fairly good matches
    - a bit low axial velocity downstreal

LES_wolf3
    - dt -> CN 0.5
    - faceMDLimited Gauss linear 0.5 on all gradients
    - linear U divscheme
    - a bit noisy still, but promising
    - very good velocity peak match (but downshifted)
    - y velocity deficits a bit wonky thus far
    - z velocities still a bit broadend but decent

LES_wolf4
    - dt -> CN 0.5
    - all else linear (except the Yi's / h)
    - leastSquares gradients


Results
-------
- Wolf 2 & 3 are promising at this point (best results so far)
- LUST is OK, but not as good as wolf's
- Still waiting on wolf 1 & 4
